## Random number generation and data visualization

This repository contains three examples (coded in three different
ways) that illustrates random number generation and simple data
visualization (plotting). Three different plotting libraries are used
(which requires users to independently download and setup/install
these libraries - instructions at the links below)

- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (Python)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib-cpp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
) (C++)
- [ROOT](https://root.cern/) (C++)

## Example usage

### [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (Python)
